Data augmentation is an essential preprocessing technique in deep learning, especially for medical image analysis where datasets are often limited. It involves generating new training samples by applying various transformations to the original images, such as rotation, horizontal and vertical flipping, zooming, shifting, and brightness adjustments.

These transformations preserve the original class labels while introducing variability in image orientation, scale, and appearance. By exposing the model to a wider range of image variations, data augmentation improves robustness, enhances generalization to unseen data, and reduces the risk of overfitting. In brain disease detection tasks, data augmentation plays a crucial role in improving the reliability and accuracy of CNN-based models.
